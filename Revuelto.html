    <h1>LAMBORGHINI REVUELTO</h1>
    <p>Just before the 60th anniversary of the marque, Lamborghini unveiled Revuelto, the first HPEV (High Performance Electrified Vehicle) hybrid super sports car. With the Revuelto, Lamborghini has established a new benchmark in performance, on-board technology, and driving pleasure. The ultimate thrill provided by the Revuelto is reached thanks to a powertrain that delivers 1015 CV total, combining the power of a brand-new 12-cylinder internal combustion engine with three high-density electric motors and a groundbreaking transversal dual clutch e-gearbox. The power of hybridization is harnessed to take performance and driving emotions to an unprecedented level.</p>
